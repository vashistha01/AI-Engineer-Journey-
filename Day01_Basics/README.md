Python Refresher with Twist
No random syntax drills. Instead, solving these mini projects:

Task 1: Write a script that reads a CSV file (dataset from Kaggle iris.csv) and:
Prints basic stats (rows, cols, nulls).
Finds min, max, mean using pure Python loops (no pandas yet).

Task 2: Convert the same script using pandas and compare how short it becomes.

Goal: See why libraries matter and how logic translates.
